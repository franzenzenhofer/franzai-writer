   - ✅ Proper parameter extraction from form fields

2. **Thinking Mode**
   - ✅ Configured thinking mode with budget settings
   - ✅ Integration with gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp model

3. **Function Calling**
   - ✅ Tool registration system with dynamic loading
   - ✅ Sample tools implemented (calculator, weatherTool, unitConverter)
   - ✅ Function execution with timeout protection

4. **Code Execution**
   - ✅ Python code interpreter integration
   - ✅ Support for generating charts and visualizations
   - ✅ Image extraction from code output

5. **Streaming**
   - ✅ Real-time token streaming implementation
   - ✅ Proper handling of streamed responses in both chat and single generation modes

6. **Chat Mode**
   - ✅ Multi-turn conversation support

   - ✅ System instructions support

7. **Files API**
   - ✅ Enhanced upload endpoint to use Gemini Files API for large files (>10MB)
   - ✅ Fallback to local storage for smaller files

### UI Components
- ✅ `GroundingSourcesDisplay` - Shows citations from search/URLs
- ✅ `FunctionCallsDisplay` - Displays tool usage with inputs/outputs
- ✅ `CodeExecutionDisplay` - Shows code, output, images, and console
- ✅ Integration in `stage-output-area.tsx`

### Testing & Quality
- ✅ Comprehensive E2E test suite (`gemini-tools-test.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Error handling with retry logic for API calls
- ✅ Timeout protection for long-running operations
- ✅ Detailed error messages for common failure scenarios

### Workflow & Prompts
- ✅ Complete `gemini-tools-test` workflow with 13 stages
- ✅ All prompt files created and configured
- ✅ Proper stage dependencies and auto-run configuration

## Pending Tasks ⏳

### Minor UI Components
- ⏳ ThinkingStepsDisplay component (currently using existing display)
- ⏳ ChatHistoryDisplay component (basic implementation exists)
- ⏳ StreamingDisplay component (streaming works, dedicated UI pending)
- ⏳ FileUploadProgress component

### TypeScript Issues
- ⏳ Fix type definitions for @google/genai SDK
- ⏳ Resolve test library import issues
- ⏳ Update function parameter types

### Documentation
- ⏳ Create user documentation for each Gemini feature
- ⏳ Add inline code comments
- ⏳ Update README with Gemini features

## Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Some type definition issues with the @google/genai SDK that need resolution
2. **Test Imports**: Testing library imports need updating for latest versions
3. **Function Type**: The 'Function' icon from lucide-react needs to be replaced

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining TypeScript issues
2. Run full test suite and fix any failures
3. Create remaining UI components for better UX
4. Add user documentation
5. Test with real Gemini API calls in production environment
