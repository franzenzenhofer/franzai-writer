### **Summary**

This ticket proposes the enhancement of our Gemini integration to include support for three key features: grounding with Google Search, using URLs as context, and on-demand image generation. The goal is to leverage these advanced capabilities within our existing and future workflows to improve our product's power and versatility.

### **Background**

The Gemini API offers a rich set of features that we are not yet fully utilizing. As seen in the internal documentation (`docs/unstructured-gemini-documentation/structured.md`), capabilities like grounding, URL context, and image generation are available and well-documented.

**Note:** All developers working on this ticket should thoroughly review the documentation in the `docs/unstructured-gemini-documentation/` folder to understand the full capabilities and implementation details of the Gemini API before starting work.

Integrating them will allow us to create more intelligent, context-aware, and engaging workflows. This is crucial for staying competitive and delivering cutting-edge solutions to our users.

### **Requirements**

The implementation must follow our core engineering principles: **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**. The new functionalities should be integrated in a clean, maintainable, and reusable way.

1.  **Grounding with Google Search:**
    *   **Description:** Workflows should be able to use Google Search as a tool to ground their responses in real-time, verifiable information from the web. This is essential for tasks requiring up-to-date knowledge or factual accuracy.
    *   **Updated Documentation (2025-06-13):** See `/docs/gemini-grounding-capabilities.md` for comprehensive model support matrix and implementation details.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A service or module is created to allow any workflow to easily enable and configure grounding.
        *   Existing workflows (e.g., content generation, research assistants) are updated to use grounding where it provides clear value.
        *   The implementation handles search suggestions and retrieval gracefully.
        *   Model compatibility checks are in place (all models except Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite support grounding).

2.  **URL Context:**
    *   **Description:** Enable workflows to ingest content from a given URL and use it as a primary context for generating outputs. This allows for tasks like summarizing articles, analyzing web pages, or extracting specific information from a link.
    *   **Updated Documentation (2025-06-13):** URL context is supported on all Gemini models except 2.0 Flash-Lite. See `/docs/gemini-grounding-capabilities.md` for details.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A reusable function/service is developed to fetch and process content from URLs for use in Gemini prompts.
        *   Workflows that could benefit from web page context (e.g., SEO analysis, content adaptation) are refactored to use this feature.
        *   The implementation is robust and handles potential fetching errors or timeouts.
        *   Model compatibility is verified before using URL context features.

3.  **Image Generation:**
    *   **Description:** Integrate Gemini's image generation capabilities (text-to-image) directly into workflows. This will enable the creation of visuals, illustrations, or diagrams on the fly, based on the textual content being processed.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   A clear interface is provided for workflows to request image generation with specific prompts.
        *   The system can handle the generated image data (e.g., save it, display it, pass it to the next step).
        *   Relevant workflows, such as article creation or social media post generation, are enhanced with optional or automatic image generation.

### **Call to Action**

The engineering team is requested to:
1.  Review the existing codebase and identify all workflows that could be improved by these new features.
2.  Design a clean, abstract implementation that avoids code duplication and is easy for all workflows to consume.
3.  Prioritize the implementation of these features and provide an estimated timeline.
4.  Ensure the final implementation is well-documented and includes examples.
