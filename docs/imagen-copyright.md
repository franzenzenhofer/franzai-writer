# Imagen Copyright & Attribution Requirements

## Executive Summary

Based on research conducted in January 2025, Google Imagen-generated images require **disclosure of AI generation** but do not require specific copyright attribution to Google. Users retain rights to generated content but must comply with applicable laws and transparency requirements.

## Key Findings

### 1. Copyright Ownership
- **Google's Position**: Google won't claim ownership over generated content (per Gemini API Terms)
- **User Rights**: Users retain rights to generated images
- **Legal Reality**: AI-generated images cannot receive copyright protection under current U.S. law (requires human authorship)
- **User Responsibility**: Users are responsible for compliance with applicable laws

### 2. Required Disclosures
- **Mandatory**: Must "clearly disclose" to users that images are AI-generated (per Responsible AI guidelines)
- **Purpose**: Maintain transparency and trust, combat misinformation
- **No Specific Text**: Google doesn't mandate specific attribution wording

### 3. Commercial Use Rights
- **Permitted**: Commercial use is allowed for AI-generated images
- **Restrictions**: Must not infringe existing IP rights or replicate existing content
- **Safety Filters**: Built-in filters prevent policy violations

### 4. Technical Details
- **SynthID Watermark**: All generated images include non-visible digital watermark
- **Only English**: Currently supports English prompts only
- **Paid Tier**: Imagen 3 requires paid subscription

## Legal Context & Risks

### Current Litigation
- Ongoing lawsuits against Google by visual artists claiming unauthorized training data use
- Copyright landscape for AI-generated content is evolving rapidly

### Intellectual Property Considerations
- Cannot create images of copyrighted characters (e.g., Mickey Mouse)
- Must respect existing trademarks and IP rights
- Users can copyright substantial creative modifications to AI-generated images

## Implementation Requirements

### Minimum Compliance
1. **Disclosure Requirement**: Include clear statement that image was AI-generated
2. **Transparency**: Make AI generation obvious to end users
3. **Legal Compliance**: Follow applicable local laws regarding AI content

### Recommended Attribution Text
```
Generated with AI using Google Imagen
```

### Alternative Formats
- **Technical**: "Image generated using Google Imagen AI"
- **Simple**: "AI-generated image"
- **Detailed**: "Created with artificial intelligence using Google's Imagen model"

## Export Format Guidelines

### Styled HTML
- Small font size (0.75rem)
- Muted color to avoid visual disruption
- Use `<figcaption>` or footer placement
- ARIA labeling for accessibility

### Clean HTML
- Plain text in `<figcaption>` or `<footer>`
- No inline styles

### Markdown
- Footnote style at bottom: `[1] Generated with AI using Google Imagen`
- Or inline after image: `*Generated with AI using Google Imagen*`

### PDF/DOCX
- Footer line on page or below image
- 9pt grey text to maintain visual hierarchy

### SEO Considerations
- Add `<meta name="generator" content="Google Imagen AI">` when applicable
- OpenGraph `og:image:alt` should mention AI generation

## Configuration Options

### Attribution Control
```json
{
  "imageAttribution": {
    "mode": "auto",  // "auto" | "hide" | "show"
    "provider": "Imagen",
    "text": "Generated with AI using Google Imagen",
    "placement": "below_image",  // "below_image" | "footer" | "caption"
    "style": "muted"  // "muted" | "normal" | "hidden"
  }
}
```

### Legal Compliance Modes
- **auto** (default): Show attribution when legally required
- **hide**: Only when explicitly allowed by license (not recommended)
- **show**: Always display attribution for maximum transparency
