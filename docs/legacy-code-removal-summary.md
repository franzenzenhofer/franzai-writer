# Legacy Code Removal Summary - 2024-07-25

This document summarizes the changes made as part of the legacy code removal initiative, based on the issue requesting the deletion of all old/legacy/mock/fallback data and logic.

## Changes Made:

1.  **Removed `src/lib/mock-data.ts`**:
    *   **Rationale**: Although this file had been recently refactored, its name and original purpose were related to mock data. To strictly adhere to the "no mock data" policy, it was removed. Functionality for creating new, empty wizard instances (if still required) should be managed by the components or services that need it.
    *   **Impact**: No direct impact expected as the file was reportedly not providing pre-filled mock document states anymore.

2.  **Removed Test API Endpoint `src/app/api/test-ai/route.ts`**:
    *   **Rationale**: This API route was designed for testing an AI stage with a hardcoded prompt. Such test-specific utilities are not suitable for production code.
    *   **Impact**: Developers and automated tests relying on this specific endpoint for AI stage testing will need to use alternative methods or dedicated testing environments.

3.  **Removed Test API Endpoint `src/app/api/test-env/route.ts`**:
    *   **Rationale**: This API route was used to check environment variables. While useful for debugging, it's not essential for production functionality and could expose environment configuration.
    *   **Impact**: Debugging or frontend checks relying on this endpoint will need to be updated.

## Items Reviewed but Retained:

1.  **Demo Mode Functionality**:
    *   **Description**: The application includes a demo mode (enabled by `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` environment variable) that allows bypassing authentication, primarily for testing and development purposes. This is implemented in `src/components/auth/auth-guard.tsx`.
    *   **Decision**: After review and user feedback, this functionality has been **retained** to ensure testing capabilities are not hampered.
    *   **Documentation**: This feature and the decision to keep it are documented in ticket `open-tickets/042-review-demo-mode-functionality.md`. It may be revisited in the future.

## General Approach:

The "fail fast, fail hard" principle was applied to aggressively remove any code that could be interpreted as legacy, mock, or a development-only utility not intended for the final production application.
