# Isolation Test Log

## Test 1: Minimal Working Page
- **Status**: ✅ WORKS
- **Code**: Just returns a div
- **Result**: Page loads successfully

## Test 2: Add Type Imports
- **Added**: Type imports from @/types
- **Status**: ✅ WORKS
- **Result**: Page loads successfully with type imports

## Test 3: Add workflow-loader
- **Added**: Import getWorkflowByShortName
- **Status**: ✅ WORKS
- **Result**: Page loads, workflow loader works

## Test 4: Import WizardPageContent (client component)
- **Added**: Import the client component
- **Status**: ✅ WORKS
- **Result**: Page loads successfully with WizardPageContent import
- **Note**: Just importing doesn't cause hang - need to actually use it

## Test 5: Render WizardPageContent
- **Added**: Actually render the WizardPageContent component with mock props
- **Status**: ❌ HANGS
- **Result**: Compilation hangs - request times out after 10 seconds
- **Finding**: The issue is in rendering WizardPageContent, not just importing it

## Test 6: Import AuthGuard
- **Added**: Import AuthGuard from @/components/auth/auth-guard
- **Status**: ❌ HANGS
- **Result**: Even just importing AuthGuard causes compilation hang
- **Finding**: The issue is narrowed down to AuthGuard or its dependencies

## Test 7: Import useAuth from app-providers
- **Added**: Import useAuth from @/components/layout/app-providers  
- **Status**: ✅ WORKS
- **Result**: Just importing useAuth works fine
- **Note**: The issue is not with useAuth itself

## Test 8: Use useAuth hook in client component
- **Added**: Made component "use client" and actually called useAuth()
- **Status**: ✅ WORKS  
- **Result**: Using useAuth in a client component works fine
- **Finding**: The issue might be related to server/client boundary

## Test 9: Import WizardShell
- **Added**: Import WizardShell from @/components/wizard/wizard-shell
- **Status**: ✅ WORKS
- **Result**: Just importing WizardShell works fine
- **Note**: The issue is not with WizardShell import itself

## Test 10: Import runAiStage from aiActions-new
- **Added**: Import runAiStage server action
- **Status**: ✅ WORKS
- **Result**: Just importing the server action works fine
- **Finding**: The issue is not with the server action import itself

## Test 11: Import AuthGuard in client component
- **Added**: Made test page "use client" and imported AuthGuard
- **Status**: ✅ WORKS
- **Result**: AuthGuard works fine when imported in a client component
- **Finding**: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - AuthGuard cannot be imported in server components

## Root Cause Summary
The compilation hang occurs when trying to import `AuthGuard` (a client component that uses hooks) in a server component context. This creates a server/client boundary violation that causes Next.js/Turbopack to hang during module resolution.

## UPDATED: Further Investigation After Removing AuthGuard
After removing AuthGuard from WizardPageContent and testing with a fresh server, the hang persisted. This indicates AuthGuard was NOT the root cause. 

## Test 12: Firebase Module-Level Errors
- **Finding**: src/lib/firebase.ts has module-level validation that throws errors at import time
- **Code**: Lines 29-34 throw errors if Firebase env vars are missing
- **Theory**: Module-level errors during server component rendering may cause compilation hangs
