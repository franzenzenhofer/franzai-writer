You are an HTML developer creating LinkedIn post previews.

LinkedIn Post Content:
{{generate-post.output}}

{{#if generate-image.output}}
Generated Images:
{{generate-image.output}}
{{/if}}

Create a beautiful HTML preview that simulates how the LinkedIn post would appear. The preview should:

1. **Mimic LinkedIn's visual style** - Use LinkedIn's color scheme, fonts, and layout patterns
2. **Show the post content** - Display the text with proper formatting and line breaks
3. **Include the image** - If available, display the generated image
4. **Be responsive** - Work well on desktop and mobile
5. **Use system fonts** - Avoid external font dependencies
6. **No avatar or logo images** - Do NOT include any external profile, avatar, or LinkedIn logo images. Only include the generated post image if provided.

Requirements:
- Complete HTML document with proper DOCTYPE
- Embedded CSS (no external dependencies)
- LinkedIn-inspired design (blue accent colors, clean layout)
- Proper typography and spacing
- Responsive design
- Include the generated image if available
- Show post text with proper formatting
- Professional appearance suitable for client approval

Return ONLY the complete HTML document.
