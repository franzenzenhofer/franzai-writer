This system will be housed in a new IBM Quantum Data Center in Poughkeepsie, New York, and is projected to perform 20,000 times more operations than current quantum computers. Key to this is the development of processors like IBM Quantum Loon (expected in 2025) and IBM Quantum Kookaburra (2026), which are designed to test and implement error correction and modularity. A large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer could revolutionize fields like drug development, materials discovery, and chemistry by enabling the execution of hundreds of millions to billions of operations.

CUDA-Q is an open-source platform that allows hardware and software components to work together in quantum computing applications. Huang envisions a future where every supercomputer will have a quantum processing unit (QPU) connected to GPUs, enabling solutions to previously unsolvable problems. This development suggests a shift towards hybrid architectures to leverage the strengths of both quantum and classical computing.

This processor is built using a new material called a topoconductor and is designed to scale to a million qubits on a single chip. Topological qubits are expected to be more stable and less prone to errors than traditional qubits, addressing a significant challenge in quantum computing. Microsoft aims to build a fault-tolerant prototype based on topological qubits, potentially leading to more reliable and scalable quantum computers.

It comes in two versions: Magistral Small (a 24B parameter open-source version) and Magistral Medium (a more powerful, enterprise version). Magistral Medium scored 73.6% on AIME2024 and 90% with majority voting @64, while Magistral Small scored 70.7% and 83.3%, respectively. Magistral is designed to \"think things through\" like humans, bringing expertise across professional domains with transparent reasoning. It is suited for various enterprise use cases, from structured calculations and programmatic logic to decision trees and rule-based systems.

These models, including OpenAI's o1 and o3, DeepSeek R1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking, and Google Gemini Flash Thinking, can collapse when faced with increasingly complex problems. While they outperform standard LLMs on medium-difficulty puzzles, they perform worse on simple puzzles and give up prematurely on hard puzzles. The researchers suggest that these models may only provide \"The Illusion of Thinking.\" [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHpXitwZ5PrDkzQNnF-L46vppiqOXKBNc6UZLIuWLMiPyzhzZxa4UAO1WnE1G4pKbD0Ejxft3zxNNbFOg8RBb9mXpnZQl5A4YUkaFOFKaqieHgMuX8Ua63SMOHqC2uis7JyJNsfYmtKjjBxjENMAhGjmbKnbGxQsEAJSEaYBuxLFR095gl_LewLV9Odi1c3LSI=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHpXitwZ5PrDkzQNnF-L46vppiqOXKBNc6UZLIuWLMiPyzhzZxa4UAO1WnE1G4pKbD0Ejxft3zxNNbFOg8RBb9mXpnZQl5A4YUkaFOFKaqieHgMuX8Ua63SMOHqC2uis7JyJNsfYmtKjjBxjENMAhGjmbKnbGxQsEAJSEaYBuxLFR095gl_LewLV9Odi1c3LSI=) and [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGsyhy2_FWvC-c7oEU4HOsBiszZvNnSU8ZtFo4utlwm99UINM2TIq2vIxde069mUxrJKaaUEdWvi3sjqEm1hsWRqMvP0uHfv-0YL4-Ogn0j4FQhsPNwL2LRZJoctpkZagS3J_c4d5v42n4XXV7jQHtK2XlIZNouofLygxmJA41VWX9EqD0jXS4F9BpNuMG-kYktV8PwD2GdVVzdMV5vCCsyZ2PIbwaGWl3izYDLj-ydr1ZcFHmYkmA5F0KcqXT8fUg3HVCU7GoZugpdn4ylogHyXrrbI-6A-KU7o1_cFkMLYuazW90=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGsyhy2_FWvC-c7oEU4HOsBiszZvNnSU8ZtFo4utlwm99UINM2TIq2vIxde069mUxrJKaaUEdWvi3sjqEm1hsWRqMvP0uHfv-0YL4-Ogn0j4FQhsPNwL2LRZJoctpkZagS3J_c4d5v42n4XXV7jQHtK2XlIZNouofLygxmJA41VWX9EqD0jXS4F9BpNuMG-kYktV8PwD2GdVVzdMV5vCCsyZ2PIbwaGWl3izYDLj-ydr1ZcFHmYkmA5F0KcqXT8fUg3HVCU7GoZugpdn4ylogHyXrrbI-6A-KU7o1_cFkMLYuazW90=)\n3.  **Developments in Healthcare AI Reasoning Models:** Generative AI (GenAI) reasoning models are enabling healthcare professionals to work more efficiently. Recent models provide transparency into their decision-making processes and can power advanced AI agents using healthcare-specific models like Google AIM, Med-PaLM 2, or Med-R1. This auditability is crucial in healthcare, where understanding why a recommendation was made is often as important as the recommendation itself.

This system aims to tackle complex quantum states beyond current capabilities and is expected to execute 100 million quantum operations using 200 logical qubits, paving the way for the \"IBM Quantum Blue Jay\" system capable of one billion quantum operations. This development has boosted IBM's stock and is seen as a positive indicator for the quantum computing industry. \\[[2](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHDiBAKgmaQ19T-CFbAHfnFzj4BEAIslWCXffuwnDY6YVHKOZRniXU0AkZEOWeIHepzJOp3rMRo3U3AhC38sv5XOxr3NmTRKmMWL4Wvteo9FN8Wtrfxdc3rQpheMD5l8jPKKX2skir-VQ-qeXtIJNhpB6UAoSWrWWVpAVXtXzUWzEVFT4lCAXAzzlFikH5DS9h8AqWH0BfROMbHnlQMKLA/)\\]\n2.  **Oxford University Achieves Lowest Error Rate for Quantum Logic Operation:** Physicists at the University of Oxford have set a new global benchmark for the accuracy of controlling a single quantum bit, achieving an error rate of just 0.000015%, or one error in 6.7 million operations. This breakthrough is significant because reducing error rates is crucial for building reliable and fault-tolerant quantum computers. \\[[1](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHhwXesMa5hYHyOYcSpELYdXJZCVWVdNfAIWKTwOb2ja6MWJ7iQ9acJGBvLA1n49HB4VT7TloXxCquYIqt8e1DgI6szxuCC6yjbhKfzMvUTVFGBtlNLqXOC60J0S_piRXfS8ilmutN4tBoqLoz5Jm0C-jFLx2HesPLKSOor-_M/)\\]\n3.  **Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning with Photonic Quantum Circuits:** Researchers have demonstrated that even small-scale quantum computers can enhance machine learning performance using a novel photonic quantum circuit.
