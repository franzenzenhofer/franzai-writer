# Fix Summary Report - Local Development Issues

## Date: 2025-06-13

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Workflow Details Page Hanging** ✅
- **Problem**: http://localhost:9002/workflow-details/poem-generator was hanging indefinitely
- **Root Cause**: The WorkflowOverviewClient component was making blocking AI calls that caused genkit module initialization issues in Next.js API routes
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed the AI API route by adding proper dynamic imports
  - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent static optimization
  - Added comprehensive error handling with status codes
  - Server restart was required to apply the fix

### 2. **AI Model Configuration** ✅
- **Problem**: Configured model `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` didn't exist
- **Root Cause**: Wrong model name in workflow JSON files
- **Solution**: Updated all workflow files to use `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` which works reliably

### 3. **API Transparency** ✅
- **Problem**: Lack of detailed error information and status codes
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced all API responses with detailed error information
  - Added status codes to all responses (200, 400, 429, 500, 503, 504)
  - Enhanced frontend error display with visual status code badges
  - Added comprehensive logging throughout the AI flow

### 4. **Document Creation Flow** ✅
- **Problem**: Document creation was also blocking after creation
- **Status**: Working correctly - creates document and redirects properly

## Current Status

### Working Features:
- ✅ Workflow details page loads with AI-generated overview
- ✅ AI API calls work with proper timeout handling
- ✅ Document creation flow works end-to-end
- ✅ Error messages display with detailed status codes
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Firebase Emulator Status:
- ❌ Emulators are NOT running (Auth on 9099, Firestore on 8080)
- ⚠️ Application is using PRODUCTION Firebase despite `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_FIREBASE_EMULATOR=true`
- ⚠️ Need to install Java or Docker to run emulators locally

## Test Results

### Direct Gemini API: ✅ Working
- Response time: ~772ms
- Model: gemini-2.0-flash-exp

### AI via Genkit: ✅ Working
- Response time: ~4200ms
- Successfully generates workflow overviews

### API Routes: ✅ Working (after fix)
- Response time: ~1200ms
- Proper error handling and status codes

## Recommendations

### For Complete Local Development:
1. Install Java 11+ or Docker to run Firebase emulators
2. Run `firebase emulators:start` to start local emulators
3. This will prevent using production Firebase resources

### Current Workaround:
- The application works with production Firebase
- All features are functional
- Just be aware that data is being written to production Firestore

## Technical Details

### Key Changes Made:
1. Fixed genkit module initialization in API routes
2. Updated all workflow configurations to use working AI model
3. Enhanced error handling and logging throughout
4. Added visual error display with status codes
5. Fixed dynamic import issues in Next.js App Router

### Files Modified:
- `/src/app/api/workflow-overview/route.ts` - Fixed with dynamic imports
- `/src/workflows/*/workflow.json` - Updated model names
- `/src/components/workflow/workflow-overview-client.tsx` - Enhanced error display
- `/src/ai/flows/generate-workflow-overview-flow.ts` - Added logging
- `/src/lib/firebase.ts` - Enhanced connection logging

## Conclusion

The application is now fully functional for local development. The only remaining issue is that Firebase emulators are not running, so the app uses production Firebase. This is not blocking development but should be addressed by installing the required dependencies (Java/Docker) to run emulators.
