# Review Demo Mode Functionality

**Created**: 2024-07-25
**Priority**: Low
**Component**: Authentication/Testing

## Description
This ticket documents the existing demo mode functionality, which was reviewed during a legacy code cleanup initiative. The decision was made to keep the demo mode for now to maintain testing capabilities.

## Current Implementation
- Demo mode is enabled by setting the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` environment variable to `true`.
- The `AuthGuard` component (`src/components/auth/auth-guard.tsx`) checks this variable to bypass authentication if `user` is null and `isDemoMode` is true.
- This allows access to application features without requiring user login, which is beneficial for development and automated testing (as originally intended in ticket `030-enable-demo-mode-testing.md`).

## Future Consideration
While demo mode is currently retained, it could be revisited in the future if a stricter adherence to a "no fallbacks" or "production-only features" policy is required. Removing it would involve:
- Modifying `AuthGuard.tsx` to remove the `isDemoMode` logic.
- Removing the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE` environment variable from configurations.
- Updating any tests or development practices that rely on demo mode.

This ticket serves as a reminder of this feature and its current status.
