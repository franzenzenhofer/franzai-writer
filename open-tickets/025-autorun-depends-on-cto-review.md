# CTO Review: autorunDependsOn Feature

## üéØ Executive Summary
The proposed `autorunDependsOn` field is a **GOOD** solution that addresses a real use case with minimal complexity. I recommend proceeding with implementation.

## üí™ Strengths of the Approach

1. **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes - existing workflows continue to work
2. **Simple Mental Model**: Clear separation between "when can I run" vs "when do I auto-run"
3. **Minimal Code Impact**: ~50 lines of code change in one file
4. **Solves Real Problem**: Addresses actual user need in poem-generator workflow
5. **Flexible**: Can be used in other workflows where similar patterns emerge

## ü§î Concerns & Mitigations

### 1. Naming Clarity
**Concern**: `autorunDependsOn` might be confused with `dependencies`
**Mitigation**: The name is actually quite clear - it explicitly states these are dependencies for autorun. Documentation will reinforce this.

### 2. Complexity Creep
**Concern**: Are we adding complexity for an edge case?
**Analysis**: 
- This is NOT an edge case - it's a common pattern where optional stages affect automatic flow
- The complexity is well-contained and doesn't affect existing behavior
- We already have `autoRunConditions` which is MORE complex

### 3. Maintenance Burden
**Concern**: Another field to maintain and test
**Reality**: 
- The logic piggybacks on existing dependency evaluation
- Test cases are straightforward
- Actually REDUCES complexity vs trying to hack this with autoRunConditions

## üîç Alternative Analysis

### Why Not Use Existing autoRunConditions?
```json
"autoRunConditions": {
  "requiresAll": ["generate-poem", "html-briefing"]
}
```
**Problems**:
- autoRunConditions ALSO affects when stage becomes active
- Would need to add more complex logic to separate activation from autorun
- Less intuitive than a dedicated field

### Why Not a Workflow-Level Rule?
**Problems**:
- Less flexible - can't configure per-stage
- Harder to understand when looking at a single stage
- Would require more complex implementation

## ‚úÖ Decision: APPROVED

### Rationale:
1. **Cost/Benefit**: Low implementation cost, high user value
2. **Clean Design**: Follows single responsibility principle
3. **Future-Proof**: Can handle more complex workflows as we grow
4. **User-Friendly**: Workflow authors can easily understand and use it

## üìã Implementation Requirements

1. **MUST** maintain backward compatibility
2. **MUST** update TypeScript types first
3. **MUST** include comprehensive tests
4. **MUST** update documentation before releasing
5. **SHOULD** add validation to catch circular dependencies
6. **SHOULD** add debug logging for troubleshooting

## üöÄ Go/No-Go: GO

This is a well-thought-out feature that solves a real problem with minimal complexity. The implementation plan is solid and the risks are low.

**One Small Suggestion**: Consider adding a debug mode or logging that shows why a stage did/didn't autorun - this will help workflow authors understand the behavior.
