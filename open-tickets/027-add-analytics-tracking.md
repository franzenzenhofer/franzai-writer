# Add Analytics and Usage Tracking

**Created**: 2025-06-10
**Priority**: Low
**Component**: Analytics/Monitoring

## Description
Implement analytics to understand user behavior, track feature usage, and monitor application performance.

## Objectives
- Understand which workflows are most popular
- Track user journey through the wizard
- Monitor AI generation success rates
- Identify drop-off points
- Track performance metrics

## Tasks
- [ ] Choose analytics solution (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, PostHog)
- [ ] Implement privacy-compliant tracking
- [ ] Add cookie consent banner
- [ ] Track key user events
- [ ] Set up custom events for AI usage
- [ ] Create analytics dashboard
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Document tracking plan

## Events to Track

### User Journey
- Page views
- Sign up completed
- Login successful
- Workflow selected
- Wizard started
- Stage completed
- Document finalized
- Document exported

### AI Usage
```typescript
interface AIEvent {
  workflow: string;
  stage: string;
  model: string;
  tokens: number;
  duration: number;
  success: boolean;
  error?: string;
}
```

### Performance Metrics
- Page load time
- Time to interactive
- AI generation time
- API response times
- Client-side errors

### User Engagement
- Session duration
- Pages per session
- Return user rate
- Feature adoption
- Workflow completion rate

## Privacy Considerations
- GDPR compliance
- Cookie consent required
- Anonymous user IDs
- No PII in events
- Data retention policy
- User opt-out option

## Implementation Example
```typescript
// lib/analytics.ts
export const analytics = {
  track: (event: string, properties?: any) => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.gtag) {
      window.gtag('event', event, properties);
    }
  },
  
  page: (url: string) => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.gtag) {
      window.gtag('config', GA_ID, {
        page_path: url,
      });
    }
  },
};
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analytics implemented without affecting performance
- [ ] Privacy compliant with consent management
- [ ] Key metrics being tracked
- [ ] Dashboard showing insights
- [ ] No PII being collected
