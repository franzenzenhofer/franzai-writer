# 106: Optimize Duplicate Document Loading

**Created**: 2025-01-21  
**Priority**: Medium
**Component**: Performance

## Description

The WizardPage is performing excessive duplicate document loading operations for the same document ID, causing unnecessary Firebase queries and performance overhead.

Observed pattern:
```
[WizardPage] Starting page load { shortName: 'poem', documentId: 'UWipARj9NvxxsMHLHDFe' }
[WizardPage] Loading existing document: UWipARj9NvxxsMHLHDFe
[DocumentPersistence] Loading document { documentId: 'UWipARj9NvxxsMHLHDFe' }
[FirestoreAdapter] Getting document { collection: 'documents', id: 'UWipARj9NvxxsMHLHDFe' }
```

This same sequence repeats 5+ times for a single page load, resulting in redundant Firebase reads.

## Tasks

- [ ] Investigate WizardPage component for multiple render/load triggers
- [ ] Implement document loading cache/memoization
- [ ] Add request deduplication for concurrent document loads
- [ ] Review React component lifecycle and dependencies
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for document load operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- Single document ID should only trigger one Firebase query per page load
- Document loading should be cached appropriately during component lifecycle
- Performance metrics show reduced Firebase read operations
- Page load times improve due to reduced redundant queries

## Impact

- **Performance**: Unnecessary Firebase reads slow down page loads
- **Cost**: Extra Firebase read operations increase billing
- **UX**: Users experience slower loading times
- **Server**: Increased load on Firebase and application server
