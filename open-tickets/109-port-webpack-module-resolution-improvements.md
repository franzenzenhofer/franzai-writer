# Port Improvements from webpack-module-resolution Branch

**Created:** 2025-06-21
**Priority:** Medium-High
**Component:** Build System, Documentation, UI/UX
**Type:** Enhancement

## Overview

The `origin/fix/webpack-module-resolution` branch contains several improvements that should be ported to our codebase. Note: Despite its name, this branch doesn't actually fix webpack issues but contains other valuable improvements.

## Changes to Port

### 1. Build Info System

**What it adds:**
- `scripts/generate-build-info.js` - Generates build metadata
- Version info component for tracking deployments
- Build timestamp and git commit info

**Why we need it:**
- Track which version is deployed in production
- Debug issues with specific builds
- Know when the last deployment happened

**Files to create/modify:**
- `scripts/generate-build-info.js`
- `src/components/build-info.tsx`
- Update `package.json` build scripts

### 2. Design Guidelines Documentation

**What it adds:**
- Comprehensive design system documentation
- Color palette definitions
- Typography guidelines
- Component design patterns

**Why we need it:**
- Ensure consistent UI across the application
- Guide future development
- Document design decisions

**Files to create:**
- `docs/design-guidelines.md`
- `src/styles/design-tokens.ts` (if applicable)

### 3. Autosave UX Improvements

**Changes made:**
- Removed visual autosave indicators
- Made autosave more subtle
- Reduced UI noise

**Why we need it:**
- Less distracting user experience
- Cleaner interface
- Users don't need constant save confirmations

### 4. Firestore Data Cleaning Improvements

**Current approach:** Convert everything to strings (ULTIMATE FIX)
**Branch approach:** Aggressive cleaning with depth/size limits

**Recommendation:**
- Keep our current approach as it works
- Consider adding size limits from the branch
- Add the depth checking for nested objects

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1 - Build Info**:
   - Port the build info generation script
   - Add to build pipeline
   - Create UI component to display version

2. **Phase 2 - Documentation**:
   - Port design guidelines
   - Review and update for current design
   - Add to developer docs

3. **Phase 3 - UX Improvements**:
   - Carefully review autosave changes
   - Test with users before removing indicators
   - Ensure save status is still discoverable

4. **Phase 4 - Firestore Enhancements** (Optional):
   - Evaluate if we need the depth/size limits
   - Our current solution works, so low priority

## Files from Branch

Key files that were modified:
- `src/lib/document-persistence.ts` (Firestore cleaning)
- `src/components/wizard/wizard-shell.tsx` (Autosave UX)
- `scripts/generate-build-info.js` (NEW)
- `docs/design-guidelines.md` (NEW)

## Testing Requirements

- Ensure build info generation works in CI/CD
- Test autosave changes don't confuse users
- Verify no regression in Firestore data handling

## Notes

- This branch name is misleading - no webpack fixes included
- Cherry-pick only the improvements we need
- Our Firestore fix is already working, so be careful with those changes
