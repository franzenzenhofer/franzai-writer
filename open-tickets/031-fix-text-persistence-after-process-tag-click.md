# Fix Text Persistence After Process Tag Click

**Created**: 2025-01-07
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Component**: Wizard/UI

## Description
After clicking a process tag in the wizard, previously entered text is not displayed. This creates a poor user experience where users lose sight of their input data and may think their work has been lost.

## Current Issue
- User enters text in wizard fields
- User clicks on a process tag to proceed
- Previously entered text disappears from view
- Text may still be stored but not visible to user
- Creates confusion about data persistence

## Expected Behavior
- Previously entered text should remain visible after clicking process tags
- User should see their input data throughout the process
- Text fields should retain and display entered values

## Tasks
- [ ] Investigate wizard state management for text persistence
- [ ] Check if text is stored but not displayed
- [ ] Identify where the display issue occurs after process tag click
- [ ] Fix text display to show previously entered values
- [ ] Test text persistence across all wizard steps
- [ ] Ensure consistent behavior across different process tags

## Technical Investigation Needed
- [ ] Review wizard component state management
- [ ] Check form field value binding
- [ ] Verify if issue is with state or display
- [ ] Test on different wizard workflows

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Previously entered text remains visible after process tag clicks
- [ ] Text persistence works across all wizard steps
- [ ] No data loss or display issues in wizard forms
- [ ] Consistent behavior across different workflows
