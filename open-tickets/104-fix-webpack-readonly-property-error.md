# 104: Fix Webpack Read-Only Property TypeError and Validation Error

**Created**: 2025-01-21
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Component**: Build Configuration

## Description

The development server is crashing with multiple related errors around webpack's watchOptions.ignored configuration:

1. First attempt shows a TypeError:
```
TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'ignored' of object '#<Object>'
    at Object.webpack (next.config.compiled.js:71:41)
```

2. Subsequent attempts show a validation error:
```
Error [ValidationError]: Invalid configuration object. Webpack has been initialized using a configuration object that does not match the API schema.
 - configuration[0].watchOptions.ignored[0] should be a non-empty string.
   -> A glob pattern for files that should be ignored from watching.
```

This is causing the dev server to crash immediately on startup, completely blocking development work.

## Tasks

- [ ] Investigate next.config.ts webpack configuration
- [ ] Identify where 'ignored' property is being modified
- [ ] Fix the configuration to avoid modifying read-only properties
- [ ] Test that dev server starts and runs without crashing
- [ ] Ensure hot reload and file watching still work correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

- Dev server starts without TypeError
- Server remains stable during development
- File watching and hot reload continue to function
- No regression in build process

## Technical Details

- Error location: next.config.compiled.js:71:41
- The error suggests webpack configuration is trying to modify a frozen or read-only object
- This may be related to the Watchpack configuration mentioned in ticket 102

## Impact

- **Severity**: HIGH - Dev server crashes
- **Frequency**: Appears to happen after some time running
- **Workaround**: Restart dev server (temporary fix)
