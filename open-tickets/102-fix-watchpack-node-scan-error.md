# 102: Fix Watchpack Node Scan Error

**Created**: 2025-06-20
**Priority**: Low
**Component**: Development Environment

## Description

The development server is showing a Watchpack error when scanning the Node.js binary path:

```
Watchpack Error (initial scan): Error: ENOTDIR: not a directory, scandir '/usr/local/bin/node'
```

This error appears during Next.js compilation but doesn't seem to affect functionality. It's likely caused by Watchpack trying to watch the Node binary path which is a file, not a directory.

## Tasks

- [ ] Investigate Watchpack configuration in Next.js
- [ ] Check if `/usr/local/bin/node` is being incorrectly added to watch paths
- [ ] Update webpack/Next.js configuration to exclude Node binary from watch paths
- [ ] Test that the error no longer appears in development mode

## Acceptance Criteria

- The Watchpack error no longer appears in the development console
- File watching continues to work correctly for actual project files
- No regression in hot module replacement functionality

## Error Details

- Occurs during: Initial compilation when starting dev server
- Frequency: Consistent on every dev server start
- Impact: Cosmetic - no functional impact observed
