# Change "Process Stage" Button to "Continue"

**Created**: 2025-01-07
**Priority**: LOW
**Component**: Wizard/UI

## Description
The current "Process Stage" button text is unclear and doesn't provide intuitive guidance to users. "Continue" would be a more user-friendly and standard button label that clearly indicates the action.

## Current Issue
- Button says "Process Stage" which is technical jargon
- Users may not understand what "Process Stage" means
- Not intuitive for non-technical users
- Doesn't follow common UI patterns

## Proposed Change
- Replace "Process Stage" button text with "Continue"
- Use standard, clear terminology
- Improve user experience with familiar language
- Follow common web application patterns

## Tasks
- [ ] Locate all instances of "Process Stage" button text
- [ ] Replace with "Continue" in wizard components
- [ ] Update any related button styling if needed
- [ ] Ensure consistent button labeling across workflows
- [ ] Test button functionality remains unchanged
- [ ] Update any tooltips or help text if necessary

## Technical Investigation
- [ ] Search codebase for "Process Stage" text
- [ ] Identify all wizard components with this button
- [ ] Check if text is hardcoded or configurable
- [ ] Verify no other functionality depends on this text

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All "Process Stage" buttons changed to "Continue"
- [ ] Button functionality remains identical
- [ ] Consistent labeling across all wizard workflows
- [ ] No broken references or dependencies
- [ ] Improved user experience with clearer language
