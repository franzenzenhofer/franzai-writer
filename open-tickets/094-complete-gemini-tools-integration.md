# Complete Gemini Tools Integration

**Created**: 2025-06-13
**Priority**: High
**Component**: AI Integration

## Description

While we have successfully implemented the Gemini Tools Test workflow with all 13 stages, there are still some issues preventing full functionality, particularly with tool registration and execution.

## Current Status

### Completed:
- ✅ Created comprehensive gemini-tools-test workflow
- ✅ Implemented all UI components for displaying AI metadata
- ✅ Fixed "at least one message is required" error
- ✅ Fixed prompt template substitution ({{userInput}} now works)
- ✅ Created tool-definitions.ts to avoid runtime errors
- ✅ Added URL fetching endpoint
- ✅ Created comprehensive Playwright test suite

### Issues:
- ❌ Tools not being registered/called by Genkit
- ❌ Calculator, weather, and unit converter tools not executing
- ❌ Some Playwright tests timing out

## Tasks

- [ ] Investigate Genkit tool registration mechanism
- [ ] Fix tool loading to ensure tools are available during generation
- [ ] Test calculator function calling with proper tool execution
- [ ] Test weather tool with demo data
- [ ] Test unit converter functionality
- [ ] Verify Google Search grounding works
- [ ] Test URL context grounding
- [ ] Verify thinking mode switches to correct model
- [ ] Test code execution with Python
- [ ] Verify streaming responses work correctly
- [ ] Test chat mode with context retention
- [ ] Test image understanding
- [ ] Test document understanding
- [ ] Run full Playwright test suite with extended timeouts
- [ ] Update documentation with working examples

## Technical Details

The main issue appears to be that Genkit is not properly registering the tools defined in tool-definitions.ts. The tools are loaded but not being made available to the AI model during generation.

Potential solutions:
1. Register tools during Genkit initialization in genkit.ts
2. Use a different approach for tool definition that Genkit recognizes
3. Investigate if tools need to be registered differently for streaming vs non-streaming

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 13 stages of gemini-tools-test workflow function correctly
- [ ] Tools are called and return results when requested
- [ ] Grounding sources are displayed in UI
- [ ] Function calls are shown with inputs and outputs
- [ ] All Playwright tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated with working examples
